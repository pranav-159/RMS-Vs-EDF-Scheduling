# RMS-Vs-EDF-Scheduling
simulation of RMS &amp; EDF scheduling and comparing them with different inputs  
**About:**  
Here we wrote two programs to simulate how rms and edf scheduling algorithms work through discrete event simulation.  

**Compilation:**
- RMS:  
		g++ Assign3-RMScs20btech11018.cpp -o Assign3-RMScs20btech11018  
- EDF:  
		g++ Assign3-EDFcs20btech11018.cpp -o Assign3-EDFcs20btech11018  

**Running:**
- RMS:  
		./Assign3-RMScs20btech11018  
- EDF:  
		./Assign3-EDFcs20btech11018  
  
Here input file and output files are same as given in the assignment.
